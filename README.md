# Parter GIS api

This project was inspired by a challenge proposed by [ZÃ©Delivery](https://ze.delivery/), which consists of:

- Create endpoint to register partners, including service coverage area and address using [GIS - Geographic information system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system) and [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/)
- Create endpoint to search partner by identifier
- Create endpoint to search for the closest partner based on a location informed through latitude and longitude

More details about the challenge can be found [here](https://github.com/ZXVentures/ze-code-challenges/blob/master/backend.md).

`Examples of requests can be found in the 'client' folder`
